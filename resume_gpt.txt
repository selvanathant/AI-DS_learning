Absolutely! Here’s a **ready-to-go prompt** you can use next time to pick up exactly where you left off today:

---

**Prompt:**

*"Hi ChatGPT, last time I was working on creating a 10-slide child-friendly, techy PowerPoint presentation about you. We had basic geometric figurines (colored circles with letters) and white boxes with grey text, but I wanted to upgrade the figurines to look like robots, books, lightbulbs, globes, and other playful tech icons, all drawn programmatically without downloading images. Please continue from there and make the slides visually rich and playful for kids, keeping the techy hexagon-style background and 10-slide structure."*

When you paste this, ChatGPT will immediately know your context and continue designing the **figurines and slides** from where you left off.

If you want, I can also make a **more detailed “super prompt”** that even tells it the colors, font sizes, layout, and slide-by-slide plan — so you can just run the code next time. Do you want me to make that?
